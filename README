# Moneytool

A pretty small, yet quiet sophisticated tool for calculating coins.

By defining a shape and an alloy, this program calculates the weight and value of the coin.

The value is roughly derived from current metal prices.

## Future plans

* Creating a system that can generate 'derived' coins with a value relative to the given coin.
* Options to store coins and alloys
* Better visualization, for multiple coins
