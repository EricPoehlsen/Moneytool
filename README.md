# Moneytool

A pretty small, yet quiet sophisticated tool for calculating coins.

By defining a shape and an alloy, this program calculates the weight and value of the coin.

The elements values are roughly derived from current metal prices.

## Future plans

* storing of coins, alloys and coin sets
* 1-click generation of coin-sets ...
* Better visualization, for multiple coins
